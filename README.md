# JavaScript Chess Board

This project is a simple JavaScript-based chess board implementation.  
It dynamically generates an 8x8 chess grid in the browser, places chess pieces in their initial positions, 
and allows for basic piece movement according to chess rules.

## Features
- Chessboard is generated dynamically using JavaScript and styled with CSS.
- Pieces are displayed using Unicode chess symbols.
- Supports legal moves for pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings.
- Includes turn-based interaction between two players.
- Automatic coloring of squares in alternating light/dark pattern.
